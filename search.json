Today, the Museum’s evolving collection contains almost 200,000 works from around the world spanning the last 150 years. The collection includes an ever-expanding range of visual expression, including painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing, photography, architecture, design, film, and media and performance art.\nThe Artists dataset contains 15,243 records, representing all the artists who have work in MoMA’s collection and have been cataloged in our database. It includes basic metadata for each artist, including name, nationality, gender, birth year, death year, Wiki QID, and Getty ULAN ID.\nThis project explores the collection and aims to reveal what artworks are more flavored in modern arts, or in this collection, cutting from different aspects such as themes, scales, and gender ratio of the artworks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough analysis on the distribution of the artists and different scales of the artwork, this project researches the underlying information in this dataset, and studies implicit determinants that makes an artwork more flavored in modern art. This project focuses on social and economy environment, gender, and nationality of artists to give a general assessment of possible aspects that affects the frequency of appearance of artworks in this collection and explore the underlying reasons for the pervalence of such artworks.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes a certain type of artwork more common in modern arts and in this collection? Is it gender? Is it history backgrounds? Is it nationality, or even the size of the artwork itself?\nAre there underrepresented groups in this collection? If there are, what are these groups and what might be the cause of the underrepresentation?\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough exploring this dataset, I gradually becomes curious about these questions. The dataset itself is too large to find a certain pattern in it, but with the help of tools, it is possible for us to explore the whole dataset in condensed visualizations.\nBased off the methods we learned in class, I was interested in how mapping and text analysis could be applied in this dataset to visualize some invisible patterns in this dataset and hopefully approach my research questions and provide some insights into what are we seeing and not seeing in seemingly unbiased artwork collections and even some underrepresented artworks and groups in this collection. I hope that this project would allow us to see some implicit factors that are affecting our flavor of artworks, including reasonable factors and underlying biases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO: explain your data and your analytical process\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s start off by importing the dataset and sample some rows in the datasets.\n\n# import packages\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport math\nimport string\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport pycountry\n\nimport requests\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport nltk\n\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.sentiment import vader\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.corpus import opinion_lexicon\nfrom nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer\n\n\n# importing data\n\nartists_df = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection/raw/master/Artists.csv')\nartworks_df = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection/raw/master/Artworks.csv')\n\n\nartists_df.sample(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      ConstituentID\n      DisplayName\n      ArtistBio\n      Nationality\n      Gender\n      BeginDate\n      EndDate\n      Wiki QID\n      ULAN\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      12923\n      42593\n      Jenova (Xinghan) Chen\n      Chinese, born 1981\n      Chinese\n      Male\n      1981\n      0\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      3739\n      4179\n      Zühtü Müritoğlu\n      Turkish, 1906–1992\n      Turkish\n      Male\n      1906\n      1992\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      3488\n      3902\n      Clement Meadmore\n      Australian, 1929–2005\n      Australian\n      Male\n      1929\n      2005\n      Q1100270\n      500105583.0\n    \n    \n      2198\n      2478\n      Peter Hamburger\n      American, born 1941\n      American\n      Male\n      1941\n      0\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      12289\n      38485\n      Jeffery Keedy\n      American, born 1957\n      American\n      Male\n      1957\n      0\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nartworks_df.sample(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Title\n      Artist\n      ConstituentID\n      ArtistBio\n      Nationality\n      BeginDate\n      EndDate\n      Gender\n      Date\n      Medium\n      ...\n      ThumbnailURL\n      Circumference (cm)\n      Depth (cm)\n      Diameter (cm)\n      Height (cm)\n      Length (cm)\n      Weight (kg)\n      Width (cm)\n      Seat Height (cm)\n      Duration (sec.)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      25907\n      In-text plate (page 91) from Le Poème de l'ang...\n      Le Corbusier (Charles-Édouard Jeanneret)\n      3426\n      (French, born Switzerland. 1887–1965)\n      (French)\n      (1887)\n      (1965)\n      (Male)\n      1947–53, published 1955\n      Lithograph from an illustrated book with 121 l...\n      ...\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      39.6\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      30.8\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      16808\n      Plate 7 from POEMS FROM THE CANTO GENERAL\n      David Alfaro Siqueiros\n      5454\n      (Mexican, 1896–1974)\n      (Mexican)\n      (1896)\n      (1974)\n      (Male)\n      1966-1968\n      NaN\n      ...\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      57.0\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      104.2\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      29102\n      Amer Citron (Bitter Lemon) (plate facing page ...\n      Georges Rouault\n      5053\n      (French, 1871–1958)\n      (French)\n      (1871)\n      (1958)\n      (Male)\n      1935, published 1938\n      Aquatint, etching, and drypoint from an illust...\n      ...\n      http://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjE4OTQ1OCJd...\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      31.5\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      21.7\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      66936\n      The Beggars\n      David Sterenberg\n      5648\n      (American)\n      (American)\n      (0)\n      (0)\n      (Male)\n      NaN\n      Etching\n      ...\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      34.8\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      27.9\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      52787\n      Vacation in Tombstone, Arizona\n      Richard Day\n      1418\n      (American, born Canada. 1896–1972)\n      (American)\n      (1896)\n      (1972)\n      (Male)\n      1941\n      Gelatin silver print\n      ...\n      http://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjI1MjU3NSJd...\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      24.8\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      20.0\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n  \n\n5 rows × 29 columns\n\n\n\n\nartworks_df['Title'].sample(10)\n\n66474                                                Lacing\n123368    Draft of the text for A Declaration;

A good way would be to keep only the first part of the title, which is the part before the first ‘,’, to keep as the title of the artwork. * The original plan was to create pie plot for types of artworks and relate with other data. Since the ‘Medium’ column is much more detailed than expected, it would be hard to follow the original plan. Therefore, I decided to explore my topics cutting in from other columns.\n\n# This cell takes some time to run\n\nartworks_df['First Title'] = '-'\n\ncount = 0\nfor title in artworks_df['Title']:\n    if type(title) is str: \n        artworks_df['First Title'][count] = title.split(',')[0]\n        count = count + 1\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_103/188276451.py:8: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  artworks_df['First Title'][count] = title.split(',')[0]\n\n\nNow, there will be a new column in the dataframe containing only the first part of the title that will be used for sentiment analysis in the analysis part.\n\n# create a list for ages of artists\n\ncount = 0\nages = []\nfor bd in artists_df['BeginDate']:\n    if bd == 0:\n        count = count + 1\n        continue\n    if artists_df['EndDate'][count] == 0:\n        age = 2023 - bd\n        ages = ages + [age]\n        count = count + 1\n    else:\n        age = artists_df['EndDate'][count] - bd\n        ages = ages + [age]\n        count = count + 1\n\n# exclude some impossible values\n\nages = [age for age in ages if age < 120]\n\nplt.hist(ages)\nplt.title('Distribution of ages of artists')\nplt.xlabel('Age')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\n\nText(0, 0.5, 'Frequency')\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove is the distribution of ages of artists in this collection with impossible values excluded. We can see that the majority of artists in this collection ages from around 50 to 90.\n\n# create a list for counts of artists with and without Wiki QID\n\ntype = ['With Wiki QID', 'Without Wiki QID']\ncount = [0, 0]\n\n\nfor i in artists_df['Wiki QID']:\n    if pd.isna(i):\n        count[1] = count[1] + 1\n    else:\n        count[0] = count[0] + 1\n\nplt.barh(type, count)\n \nfor index, value in enumerate(count):\n    plt.text(value, index,str(value))\n \nplt.title('Artist Wiki QID status')\nplt.xlabel('Frequency')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe above plot shows the number of artists with and without Wiki QID. We can see that the majority of artists in this collection does not have a Wiki QID, implying that this collection probably does not have a tendency towards famous artists.\n\ndate_list = []\nfor i in artworks_df['Date']:\n  if (not pd.isna(i)) and i.isnumeric() and len(i) == 4:\n    date_list = date_list + [int(i)]\n\n\nplt.hist(date_list)\nplt.title('Distribution of Dates of Artworks')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nAbove is a histogram on the distribution of dates that artworks are created. We can see that the graph is right skewed, which means it flavors artworks that are more contemporary as a modern art collection, and has the most artworks created from early 1900s to 2000s.\n\ngender = ['Female', 'Male', 'Non-Binary', 'N/A']\ngender_count = [0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nfor i in artists_df['Gender']:\n    if pd.isna(i):\n        gender_count[3] += 1\n    elif i.lower() == 'female':\n        gender_count[0] += 1\n    elif i.lower() == 'male':\n        gender_count[1] += 1\n    elif i.lower() == 'non-binary':\n        gender_count[2] += 1\n    else:\n        gender_count[3] += 1\n\nplt.pie(gender_count, labels=gender, autopct='%1.1f%%')\nplt.title('Artists Gender')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot, we can see that most of the artists in this collection are male, 15.4% of them are female, and only nearly neglectable part of them are non-binary. This shows that male artists are more recognized and acknowledged generally within the range of collection. As shown on former graph, the major range of collection for this dataset is between 1900 and 2010, to explore more about how gender of artists could affect themselves and their artworks and how it combines with other factors such as dates and history backgrounds, it is worthy do dig deeper into the relationships of gender and other data in the following focused analysis.\nAlso, we can see that the nationality in the dataframe is noted in a different way from geopanda’s notion of country names.

It provides some general insights on the dataset, but not enough to allow us to make conclutions or imply some other underlying factors that causes such distributions.\nThe next session includes a further analysis of the data and provides visualizations to provide a deeper look into the dataset and useful insights that cuts in from a more detailed look to explore the research question.\n\n\n# add a new column 'Area' to the dataframe, rounded up to two decimals, in cm^2\nartworks_df['Area'] = '-'\n\ncount = 0\nfor a in artworks_df['Area']:\n  if pd.isna(artworks_df['Height (cm)'][count]) or pd.isna(artworks_df['Width (cm)'][count]):\n    artworks_df['Area'][count] = 0\n    count += 1\n  else:\n    artworks_df['Area'][count] = round(artworks_df['Height (cm)'][count] * artworks_df['Width (cm)'][count], 2)\n    count += 1\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_103/658045223.py:10: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  artworks_df['Area'][count] = round(artworks_df['Height (cm)'][count] * artworks_df['Width (cm)'][count], 2)\n/tmp/ipykernel_103/658045223.py:7: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  artworks_df['Area'][count] = 0\n\n\n\n# add a new column for country code for mapping\ndef alpha3code(column):\n    CODE=[]\n    for country in column:\n        try:\n            code=pycountry.countries.get(name=country).alpha_3\n           # .alpha_3 means 3-letter country code \n           # .alpha_2 means 2-letter country code\n            CODE.append(code)\n        except:\n            CODE.append('None')\n    return CODE\n\nartworks_df['CODE']=alpha3code(artworks_df.Country)\n\n\n# create a new column to store the sentiment analysis of the title\nsia = vader.SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\nmyStopWords = list(string.punctuation) + stopwords.words('english')\nporter = PorterStemmer()\n\n\nartworks_df['Sentiment Score'] = 0\n\ncount = 0\nfor t in artworks_df['First Title']:\n    t_token = [w for w in word_tokenize(t.lower()) if w not in myStopWords]\n    t_token = [porter.stem(token) for token in t_token]\n    score = 0\n    \n    for w in t_token:\n        score += sia.polarity_scores(w)['compound']\n    \n    artworks_df['Sentiment Score'][count] = score\n    count += 1\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_103/690819950.py:12: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  artworks_df['Sentiment Score'][count] = score\n\n\nIn the above part, I was intended to create a column to store the sentiment score by text analyzing the title of the artworks. This does not came as I expected as most artworks have neutral titles and have 0 compound scores.\nTherefore, I switched my focus onto studying the relationships between size and date of the artworks, and the gender and nationality of the artists.\n\ndate_min = 3000\ndate_max = 0\nfor i in artworks_df['Date']:\n  if (not pd.isna(i)) and i.isnumeric() and len(i) == 4:\n    i = int(i)\n    if i < date_min:\n        date_min = i\n    if i > date_max: \n        date_max = i\n\nprint(date_min)\nprint(date_max)\n\n1768\n2022\n\n\nSince the ‘Date’ column in the artworks data does not only contain year, I only collected these with 4-digit year number.\n\n# create a dataframe for every decade from 1760 to 2020\ndecade = [*range(1760, 2030, 10)]\ndate_df = pd.DataFrame(decade, columns=['Date'])\n\n\n# create new columns for total number, gender, and average area\ndate_df['Count'] = 0\ndate_df['Male'] = 0\ndate_df['Female'] = 0\ndate_df['Non-binary'] = 0\ndate_df['Other'] = 0\ndate_df['Area'] = 0\n\ncount = 0\nfor d in artworks_df['Date']:\n    if (not pd.isna(d)) and d.isnumeric() and len(d) == 4:\n        # round down to decade\n        d = int(d)\n        d /= 10\n        d = math.floor(d)\n        d *= 10\n        \n        # update count\n        date_df.loc[date_df['Date'] == d, 'Count'] += 1\n        \n        # update gender count\n        i = artworks_df['Gender'][count]\n        if pd.isna(i):\n            date_df.loc[date_df['Date'] == d, 'Other'] += 1\n        else:\n            i = i[1:len(i)-1]\n            if i.lower() == 'female':\n                date_df.loc[date_df['Date'] == d, 'Female'] += 1\n            elif i.lower() == 'male':\n                date_df.loc[date_df['Date'] == d, 'Male'] += 1\n            elif i.lower() == 'non-binary':\n                date_df.loc[date_df['Date'] == d, 'Non-binary'] += 1\n            else:\n                date_df.loc[date_df['Date'] == d, 'Other'] += 1\n        \n        # update area\n        a = artworks_df['Area'][count]\n        date_df.loc[date_df['Date'] == d, 'Area'] += a\n        \n        count += 1\n    else:\n        count += 1\n\ndate_df.Area /= date_df.Count\ndate_df.Area = date_df.Area.round()\n\n\ndate_df.plot(x='Date', y='Area', kind='line')\n\nplt.title('Size of Artworks vs. Time')\nplt.xlabel('Time')\nplt.ylabel('Size (cm^2)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe above graph shows the relationship of the size of artworks through time in the MoMA collection. We can see that there is roughly a exponentially increasing trend on the size of the artworks. This shows that there are more and more larger artworks in this collection. As shown in the distribution of dates of the artworks, this trend is not related to the amount of artworks of the time period in the collection.\nThis could be a result of better environments that enables artists to obtain better materials to allow them to produce larger artworks. Meanwhile, it could also be caused by the improving size and environments of the museum, which acquires its first artwork in 1929. Larger area and better maintainence techniques of museums could enable more collection of larger artworks, also encouraging the creation of artworks of larger sizes.\n\ndate_df.loc[date_df['Date']>=1880].plot(x='Date', y=['Male', 'Female', 'Non-binary', 'Other'], kind='bar')\n\n<AxesSubplot: xlabel='Date'>\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the gender pie chart in the exploration part, I also mentioned that the gender distribution is the general distribution over all of the artists in the dataset. This graph visualizes the number of artists of different gender and the distribution over years. We can see that starting from 1960s, the ratio of female artists has been increasing, which means that more and more artworks by female artists are included in this collection, though it is still worth noting that the number of artworks by male artists is always the greatest.\nThis could also be an indication of underrepresented groups in the collection. While the environment is harsher for female and non-binary artists, collection of museum could have mutual influences on the social environment, causing male artists to be easier recognized and acknowledged.\nIs is also worth noting that ‘Other’ includes all artworks by multiple artists and artists whose genders are not specified. The number of ‘Other’ artworks is also increasing with time, possibly proving the occurrence of more collaborated artworks.\n\n\ngender_list = ['Male', 'Female', 'Non-binary', 'Other']\narea_list = [0, 0, 0, 0]\narea_count = [0, 0, 0, 0]\n\ncount = 0\nfor a in artworks_df['Area']:\n    if not a == 0:\n        i = artworks_df['Gender'][count]\n        if pd.isna(i):\n            area_list[3] += a\n            area_count[3] += 1\n        else:\n            i = i[1:len(i)-1]\n            if i.lower() == 'female':\n                area_list[1] += a\n                area_count[1] += 1\n            elif i.lower() == 'male':\n                area_list[0] += a\n                area_count[0] += 1\n            elif i.lower() == 'non-binary':\n                area_list[2] += a\n                area_count[2] += 1\n            else:\n                area_list[3] += a\n                area_count[3] += 1\n    count += 1\n                \nfor i in range(0, 4):\n    if area_count[i] != 0: \n        area_list[i] /= area_count[i]\n    round(area_list[i], 2)\n\n\ngender_list.pop(2)\narea_list.pop(2)\n\n27525.76\n\n\n\nplt.bar(gender_list, area_list)\nplt.title('Size of Artworks vs. Gender')\nplt.ylabel('Size (cm^2)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThis plot reveals a funny trend about the size of artworks by different genders. The MoMA collection contains a very large number of artworks, allowing this to be a generally applicable trend in this collection that artworks by female artists in this collection is larger in size compared to artworks by male artists.\nBased on the last gender bar graph, we can tell that there are prominently more artworks by male artists than female artists. Therefore, this phenomenom could be a result of female artists being harder to get recognized and acknowledged while their artworks being considered as part of the musuem’s collection. For female artists, larger artworks are more favorable and acknowledged in this collection.\nIt is worth noting that since there is only two artworks by non-binary artists with size data, the average size of artworks by non-binary artists is remarkable greater than the other three. The dataset is too small to generate meaningful results, so I did not include them in this graph.\n\n# create a new df storing data for each country/region\n\nworld = gpd.read_file(gpd.datasets.get_path('naturalearth_lowres'))\n\n# rename the columns so that we can merge with our data\nworld.columns=['pop_est', 'continent', 'name', 'CODE', 'gdp_md_est', 'geometry']\n\n# merge with location data\nlocation=pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melanieshi0120/COVID-19_global_time_series_panel_data/master/data/countries_latitude_longitude.csv')\nworld=world.merge(location,on='name')\n\n\n# create a new column to count the number of artworks for each country/region\nworld['Count'] = 0\nfor c in artworks_df['CODE']:\n    world.loc[world['CODE'] == c, 'Count'] += 1\n\n\n# create a new column for area\nworld['Area'] = 0\nworld['AreaCount'] = 0\n\ncount = 0\nfor c in artworks_df['CODE']:\n    world.loc[world['CODE'] == c, 'Area'] += artworks_df['Area'][count]\n    if artworks_df['Area'][count] != 0:\n        world.loc[world['CODE'] == c, 'AreaCount'] += 1\n    count += 1\n\nworld.Area /= world.AreaCount\n\n\nworld.Area = world.Area.round()\n\n\n# create a new column for sentiment \nworld['Sentiment'] = 0\n\ncount = 0\nfor c in artworks_df['CODE']:\n    world.loc[world['CODE'] == c, 'Sentiment'] += artworks_df['Sentiment Score'][count]\n    count += 1\n\nworld.Sentiment /= world.Count\n\n\nworld.Sentiment = world.Sentiment.round()\n\n\n# plot count world map\nworld.plot(column='Count', scheme=\"box_plot\",\n           figsize=(25, 20),\n           legend=True,cmap='coolwarm')\nplt.title('Number of Artworks in MoMA Collection',fontsize=25)\n# add countries names and numbers \nfor i in range(0,10):\n    plt.text(float(world.longitude[i]),float(world.latitude[i]),\"{}\\n{}\".format(world.name[i],world.Count[i]),size=13)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nAbove is the distribution of the number of artworks in the MoMA collection, with red representing more artworks collected from this country/region. We can see that most artworks in this collection is from North America, South America, Austrialia, Europe, China, and India. Other than China and India, most artworks are collected from Western countries, with very few collections from north Asia, Africa, and a few North American countries/regions.\nDespite of the name “Museum of Modern Arts”, we can see that this dataset is not a great representation of modern arts of the world. It is skewed towards western modern arts and have most of its collection from only some part of the world and specific countries/regions.\n\n# plot count world map\nworld.plot(column='Area', scheme=\"quantiles\",\n           figsize=(25, 20),\n           legend=True,cmap='coolwarm')\nplt.title('Average Size of Arkworks in MoMA Collection',fontsize=25)\n# add countries names and numbers \nfor i in range(0,10):\n    plt.text(float(world.longitude[i]),float(world.latitude[i]),\"{}\\n{}\".format(world.name[i],world.Area[i]),size=13)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nAbove is the world mapped with the average size of artworks created by artists from different countries/regions. Since the mapping starts at 75 square centimeters instead of 0, some part of the mapping is missing because of lack of data from those countries/regions.\nCompared with the last map, although Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and Asia are all among the list of region with the most amount of artworks collected in this dataset, only Asia has the largest average size of artworks, with the other region having about the median average size of artworks. This could show the difference of the criterion and aesthetics between western and eastern culture.\n\n\n\n\nThrough the analysis of the five above graphs, we can see many underlying trends in this collection, with respect to date, gender, region, and size of artworks. This could reveal some implicit factors coming from and affecting how people view modern arts and how the collection is built.\n\nThere are significantly more artworks by male artists than female artists and other artists.\nThe size of artworks by female artists are genrally greater than male artists.\nThe size of artworks increases exponentially by time.\nArtworks from some regions are more flavored than other regions in this collection.\nWhile the western culture flavors artworks of medium sizes, eastern culture has a prominent tendency on artworks with greater sizes.\n\nThrough these findings, we can see the difference between aesthetics and flavor of modern arts of different cultures, while we can also see the underrepresented groups in this collection. Based off these discoveries and reasonable inferences, we can still see the bias while we are appreciating artworks.\nWhile these implicit factors could affect the process of collecting and acknowledging artworks, it can also influence the way people view arts and establish their standards and perspectives of modern arts. This could even further influence the way artists create arts, whether explicitly and implicitly.\nIt is impossible for people to completely avoid bias, whether during the process of collecting artworks, or even the way artworks are exhibited and shown to the public, but I believe that visualizing these underlying factors would allow us to see and acknowledge these biases, and be conscious of bias and differences, and to further think about and discover the underlying reasons and eventually becoming able to minimize them.\n\n\n\n\nPart of the code on mapping and geopandas comes from https://melaniesoek0120.medium.com/data-visualization-how-to-plot-a-map-with-geopandas-in-python-73b10dcd4b4b."
