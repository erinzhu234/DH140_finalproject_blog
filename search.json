Today, the Museum’s evolving collection contains almost 200,000 works from around the world spanning the last 150 years. The collection includes an ever-expanding range of visual expression, including painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing, photography, architecture, design, film, and media and performance art.\nThe Artists dataset contains 15,243 records, representing all the artists who have work in MoMA’s collection and have been cataloged in our database. It includes basic metadata for each artist, including name, nationality, gender, birth year, death year, Wiki QID, and Getty ULAN ID.\nThis project explores the collection and aims to reveal what artworks are more flavored in modern arts, or in this collection, cutting from different aspects such as themes, scales, and gender ratio of the artworks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough analysis on the distribution of the artists and different scales of the artwork, this project researches the underlying information in this dataset, and studies implicit determinants that makes an artwork more flavored in modern art. This project focuses on social and economy environment, gender, and nationality of artists to give a general assessment of possible aspects that affects the frequency of appearance of artworks in this collection and explore the underlying reasons for the pervalence of such artworks.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes a certain type of artwork more common in modern arts and in this collection? Is it gender? Is it history backgrounds? Is it nationality, or even the size of the artwork itself?\nAre there underrepresented groups in this collection? If there are, what are these groups and what might be the cause of the underrepresentation?\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough exploring this dataset, I gradually becomes curious about these questions. The dataset itself is too large to find a certain pattern in it, but with the help of tools, it is possible for us to explore the whole dataset in condensed visualizations.\nBased off the methods we learned in class, I was interested in how mapping and text analysis could be applied in this dataset to visualize some invisible patterns in this dataset and hopefully approach my research questions and provide some insights into what are we seeing and not seeing in seemingly unbiased artwork collections and even some underrepresented artworks and groups in this collection. I hope that this project would allow us to see some implicit factors that are affecting our flavor of artworks, including reasonable factors and underlying biases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO: explain your data and your analytical process\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s start off by importing the dataset and sample some rows in the datasets.\n\n# import packages\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport math\nimport string\n\n\n# importing data\n\nartists_df = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection/raw/master/Artists.csv')\nartworks_df = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection/raw/master/Artworks.csv')\n\n\nartists_df.sample(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      ConstituentID\n      DisplayName\n      ArtistBio\n      Nationality\n      Gender\n      BeginDate\n      EndDate\n      Wiki QID\n      ULAN\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      13202\n      44844\n      Eladio Dieste\n      Uruguayan, 1917–2000\n      Uruguayan\n      Male\n      1917\n      2000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      1639\n      1856\n      Gabriel Fernández Ledesma\n      Mexican, 1900–1982\n      Mexican\n      Male\n      1900\n      1982\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      8049\n      10117\n      Jernbolaget, Eskilstuna, Sweden\n      est. 1868\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      1868\n      0\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      14462\n      67948\n      Pedro Manrique Figueroa\n      Colombian, born 1934\n      Colombian\n      Male\n      1934\n      0\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      14841\n      74798\n      Mikhail Fadeev\n      Russian\n      Russian\n      Male\n      0\n      0\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nartworks_df.sample(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Title\n      Artist\n      ConstituentID\n      ArtistBio\n      Nationality\n      BeginDate\n      EndDate\n      Gender\n      Date\n      Medium\n      ...\n      ThumbnailURL\n      Circumference (cm)\n      Depth (cm)\n      Diameter (cm)\n      Height (cm)\n      Length (cm)\n      Weight (kg)\n      Width (cm)\n      Seat Height (cm)\n      Duration (sec.)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      58443\n      Flipper\n      Blinky Palermo\n      4474\n      (German, 1943–1977)\n      (German)\n      (1943)\n      (1977)\n      (Male)\n      1970\n      Screenprint on two sheets\n      ...\n      http://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjUyNzM4OCJd...\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      80.0\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      60.0\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      51834\n      Rubber Dummies, Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios, H...\n      Edward Weston\n      6329\n      (American, 1886–1958)\n      (American)\n      (1886)\n      (1958)\n      (Male)\n      1939\n      Gelatin silver print\n      ...\n      http://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjIwOTA2NSJd...\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      19.3\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      24.4\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      135340\n      Catalytic text: 20 January 2017.

A good way would be to keep only the first part of the title, which is the part before the first ‘,’, to keep as the title of the artwork. * The original plan was to create pie plot for types of artworks and relate with other data. Since the ‘Medium’ column is much more detailed than expected, it would be hard to follow the original plan. Therefore, I decided to explore my topics cutting in from other columns.\n\n# This cell takes some time to run\n\nartworks_df['First Title'] = '-'\n\ncount = 0\nfor title in artworks_df['Title']:\n    if type(title) is str: \n        artworks_df['First Title'][count] = title.split(',')[0]\n        count = count + 1\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_70/1156968381.py:6: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  artworks_df['First Title'][count] = title.split(',')[0]\n\n\nNow, there will be a new column in the dataframe containing only the first part of the title that will be used for sentiment analysis in the analysis part.\n\n# create a list for ages of artists\n\ncount = 0\nages = []\nfor bd in artists_df['BeginDate']:\n    if bd == 0:\n        count = count + 1\n        continue\n    if artists_df['EndDate'][count] == 0:\n        age = 2023 - bd\n        ages = ages + [age]\n        count = count + 1\n    else:\n        age = artists_df['EndDate'][count] - bd\n        ages = ages + [age]\n        count = count + 1\n\n# exclude some impossible values\n\nages = [age for age in ages if age < 120]\n\nplt.hist(ages)\nplt.title('Distribution of ages of artists')\nplt.xlabel('Age')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\n\nText(0, 0.5, 'Frequency')\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove is the distribution of ages of artists in this collection with impossible values excluded. We can see that the majority of artists in this collection ages from around 50 to 90.\n\n# create a list for counts of artists with and without Wiki QID\n\ntype = ['With Wiki QID', 'Without Wiki QID']\ncount = [0, 0]\n\n\nfor i in artists_df['Wiki QID']:\n    if pd.isna(i):\n        count[1] = count[1] + 1\n    else:\n        count[0] = count[0] + 1\n\nplt.barh(type, count)\n \nfor index, value in enumerate(count):\n    plt.text(value, index,str(value))\n \nplt.title('Artist Wiki QID status')\nplt.xlabel('Frequency')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe above plot shows the number of artists with and without Wiki QID. We can see that the majority of artists in this collection does not have a Wiki QID, implying that this collection probably does not have a tendency towards famous artists.\n\ndate_list = []\nfor i in artworks_df['Date']:\n  if (not pd.isna(i)) and i.isnumeric() and len(i) == 4:\n    date_list = date_list + [int(i)]\n\n\nplt.hist(date_list)\nplt.title('Distribution of Dates of Artworks')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nAbove is a histogram on the distribution of dates that artworks are created. We can see that the graph is right skewed, which means it flavors artworks that are more contemporary as a modern art collection, and has the most artworks created from early 1900s to 2000s.\n\ngender = ['Female', 'Male', 'Non-Binary', 'N/A']\ngender_count = [0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nfor i in artists_df['Gender']:\n    if pd.isna(i):\n        gender_count[3] += 1\n    elif i.lower() == 'female':\n        gender_count[0] += 1\n    elif i.lower() == 'male':\n        gender_count[1] += 1\n    elif i.lower() == 'non-binary':\n        gender_count[2] += 1\n    else:\n        gender_count[3] += 1\n\nplt.pie(gender_count, labels=gender, autopct='%1.1f%%')\nplt.title('Artists Gender')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot, we can see that most of the artists in this collection are male, 15.4% of them are female, and only nearly neglectable part of them are non-binary. This shows that male artists are more recognized and acknowledged generally within the range of collection. As shown on former graph, the major range of collection for this dataset is between 1900 and 2010, to explore more about how gender of artists could affect themselves and their artworks and how it combines with other factors such as dates and history backgrounds, it is worthy do dig deeper into the relationships of gender and other data in the following focused analysis.\n\n\n\n\nThrough some exploratoration on the dataset, we can see that this collection does not have uniform distribution on a lot of aspects of artists and artworks. It provides some general insights on the dataset, but not enough to allow us to make conclutions or imply some other underlying factors that causes such distributions.\nThe next session includes a further analysis of the data and provides visualizations to provide a deeper look into the dataset and useful insights that cuts in from a more detailed look to explore the research question.\n\n\n# add a new column 'Area' to the dataframe, rounded up to two decimals, in cm^2\nartworks_df['Area'] = '-'\n\ncount = 0\nfor a in artworks_df['Area']:\n  if pd.isna(artworks_df['Height (cm)'][count]) or pd.isna(artworks_df['Width (cm)'][count]):\n    artworks_df['Area'][count] = 0\n    count += 1\n  else:\n    artworks_df['Area'][count] = round(artworks_df['Height (cm)'][count] * artworks_df['Width (cm)'][count], 2)\n    count += 1\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_70/3976049913.py:10: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  artworks_df['Area'][count] = round(artworks_df['Height (cm)'][count] * artworks_df['Width (cm)'][count], 2)\n/tmp/ipykernel_70/3976049913.py:7: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  artworks_df['Area'][count] = 0\n\n\nTODO: analysis 1\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO: what does the analysis show, big picture, and how are they useful\nlink back to research questions"
